Types
+++++
RFLang types are *very* rudementary at the moment (i.e. no ability for defining custom types)

BuiltIns

  | short    | 2 bytes  |

  | int      | 4 bytes  |
  +----------+----------+
  | long     | 8 bytes  |
  +----------+----------+

Custom Types
------------
.. warning::
  Custom types are not supported, but are planned for the future at some point, but are a bit out of the scope of what I am willing to work on right now.
